    "# Regression Analysis using Linear Algebra and NumPy - Code Along \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, you learned that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between data entities (variables). Linear regression is an important predictive analytical tool in the data scientist's toolbox. Here, you'll try and develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrix operations. This lesson covers least-squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "[You can find a deeper mathematical and geometric explanation of the topic here](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). In this lesson, we'll try to keep things more data-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "- Indicate how linear algebra is related to regression modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you know that the purpose of the regression process is to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed points, in order to later use that model for predicting new values e.g. predicting sales, based on historical sales figures, predicting house prices based on different features of the house, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a very simple toy example to understand how this works with linear algebra. Say you are collecting data on total number of sales per day for some business. Imagine you've got three data points in the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "(day, total number of sales(in hundreds)) \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot these points on a scatter plot with day (x-axis) vs. sales figures (y-axis), this is what we get:\n",
    "\n",

If you do this, you first assume that there is an underlying relationship that maps “days” uniquely to “number of sales”, that can be written in the function form as an equation of the straight line i.e. \n",

These documents will provide you with a visual intuition as well as an in-depth mathematical formulation for above equations along with their proofs. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you had a gentle introduction to how we can use linear algebra to solve regression problems. You saw a toy example in the case of simple linear regression, relating days to number of sales and calculated a function that approximates the linear mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned about how linear regression works in the context of multiple input variables and linear algebra. In the next lab, you'll use these equations to solve a real world problem. "
